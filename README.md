📌 Project Objective
To analyze and visualize the financial performance of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL) over a 6-year period (FY20–FY25) using both Excel and Power BI. The goal was to understand trends in revenue, profitability, liquidity, and capital efficiency, and to build an interactive dashboard for presenting insights to stakeholders.

🟦 Part 1: Excel-Based Financial Analysis
This section involved collecting and analyzing historical financial data in Excel.

✅ Metrics Analyzed:
Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income

EBITDA Margin & Net Profit Margin

YoY Growth % and CAGR

Working Capital

Operating Cash Flow

Return on Equity (ROE)

Liquidity Ratios (Current Ratio)

Solvency Ratios (Debt-to-Equity)

📈 Key Insights:
Revenue CAGR of 8.14%, showing steady top-line growth.

EBITDA and Net Income also grew at ~7.8–7.9% CAGR, with margins remaining stable (~25% EBITDA margin and ~16.5% net margin).

ROE improved from 16.76% in FY21 to 21.47% in FY25, showing increased efficiency in generating shareholder returns.

Working Capital peaked in FY24 but declined in FY25, suggesting a potential strain in liquidity management.

The Current Ratio stayed above 1.3, reflecting a safe short-term liquidity position.

Debt-to-Equity ratio stayed low (<0.65 post-FY21), indicating a conservative capital structure and low financial risk.

🧠 Interpretation:
This structured tabular analysis helped me understand not just the growth of HUL over time, but also how its operational efficiency and capital structure evolved. The company displayed strong financial health, but signs of slower growth and a drop in working capital in FY25 signal areas to watch.

🟩 Part 2: Power BI Dashboard
The Excel insights were translated into a clean, interactive dashboard in Power BI.

📊 Dashboard Components:
Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income trends (column and line charts)

EBITDA Margin & Net Profit Margin (line charts)

ROE (%) – visualized using a gauge chart for FY25

Working Capital and Operating Cash Flow trends

Current Assets vs Liabilities (stacked column chart)

Equity Growth

YoY Growth % with conditional formatting

KPI Cards for key metrics and CAGR summaries

🧠 Interpretation:
The Power BI dashboard allows users to interact with the data and drill down into the financial story quickly. Stakeholders can track how profit margins held steady even as growth slowed, or how the company’s low leverage (Debt-to-Equity) was maintained over time. Conditional formatting helps spot declining or improving KPIs at a glance.

🎯 Final Takeaways
📌 Excel was ideal for calculating, organizing, and interpreting financial statements and ratios.

📌 Power BI brought the story to life through interactive, executive-ready visuals.

📌 The combined approach offers both depth and accessibility — turning financial numbers into actionable business insights.
